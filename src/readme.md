"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and 
islike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of 
leasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee 
he pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to 
hose who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same 
s saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are 
perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our 
power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being 
ble to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every 
ain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of 
uty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that 
leasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man 
herefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: 
 rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he 
 ndures pains to avoid worse pains."
